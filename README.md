# Proton Exchange Membrane (PEM) Fuel Cell Dataset

## Overview

This dataset are about Nafion 112 membrane standard tests and MEA activation
tests of PEM fuel cell in various operation condition. Dataset include two general electrochemical
analysis method, Polarization and Impedance curves. In this dataset, effect of different pressure of
H2/O2 gas, different voltages and various humidity conditions in several steps are considered.
Behavior of PEM fuel cell during distinct operation condition tests, activation procedure and different operation condition
before and after activation analysis can be concluded from data. In Polarization curves, voltage
and power density change as a function of flows of H2/O2 and relative humidity. Resistance of the
used equivalent circuit of fuel cell can be calculated from Impedance data. Thus, experimental
response of the cell is obvious in the presented data, which is useful in depth analysis, simulation
and material performance investigation in PEM fuel cell researches.
